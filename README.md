## About Me
I am an engineer from Morocco with a focus on **technology, AI, and data-driven solutions**.  
I enjoy **analyzing problems, experimenting with ideas, and learning deeply** before applying solutions practically.  

I prioritize **understanding over imitation**, because strong foundations lead to **robust and maintainable systems**.

## Approach & Philosophy
- **Problem-first mindset:** Understanding the problem thoroughly ensures solutions are **effective and relevant**.  
- **Practical experimentation:** Learning by doing allows me to **validate ideas and discover insights**.  
- **Continuous improvement:** Reflecting on outcomes helps me **refine methods and grow expertise**.  
- **Knowledge sharing:** Documenting processes improves **personal clarity** and helps **others learn**.  
- **MLOps & Development Foundations:** I focus on building systems that are **scalable, reliable, and maintainable**, emphasizing **practical foundations over complexity**.
