# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ibrahim Lahlou
## A passionate Data Engineer & ML Ops Engineer from Morocco

I am a Moroccan living in Casablanca and currently a second-year student of Data Science & Cloud Computing Engineering at ENSA Oujda, after completing my preparatory classes in the same school.

I am interested in Data Engineering, DevOps, and Machine Learning. I enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React for web development.

I am also interested in incorporating LaTeX into my programming projects to give the code a mathematical touch. Here's an example of the coefficient of determination using LaTeX


![Coefficient of Determination](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R^2%20%3D%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cwidehat%7BVar%7D%28%5Cwidehat%7By%7D%29%7D%7B%5Cwidehat%7BVar%7D%28y%29%7D)
