## About Me

ML Engineer and Data Scientist based in Morocco, focused on understanding and solving complex problems through data-driven approaches. I prioritize deep understanding over surface-level implementation studying fundamentals, analyzing trade-offs, and building solutions grounded in solid principles.

## Research Interests

**Machine Learning Systems**   
Designing, training, and deploying models that generalize well and remain maintainable in production. Focus on the complete lifecycle from problem formulation to continuous improvement.

**Natural Language Processing**   
Exploring data and some text based subjects structures, evaluation. Building algorithms that capture language nuances and provide meaningful feedback.

**Recommendation & Decision Systems**   
Extracting actionable insights from complex data patterns. Understanding user behavior, market dynamics, and information retrieval principles.

**Time Series & Forecasting**   
Analyzing temporal patterns, understanding autocorrelation structures, and building predictive models that account for uncertainty.

## Approach

**Problem-first mindset**   
Thoroughly understanding the problem domain, stakeholder needs, and success criteria before committing to solutions.

**Practical experimentation**   
Learning through systematic experimentation formulating hypotheses, analyzing results, and iterating based on evidence.

**Continuous improvement**   
Documenting what works, what fails, and why. Building deeper understanding that informs future work.

**Foundation over complexity**   
Understanding core principles deeply rather than accumulating superficial knowledge. Strong fundamentals enable adaptation.
